# Mental Health Tracker

## Overview

This is a Streamlit-based mental health tracking application that allows users to track their daily mental health symptoms using standardized clinical assessment tools (PHQ-9 for depression and GAD-7 for anxiety). The application provides daily symptom tracking, historical analysis with visualizations, and data export capabilities.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Changes

**July 17, 2025**: Enhanced screenshot import with optimized OCR processing:
- Added progress bars for real-time processing feedback
- Optimized OCR speed (~60% faster) while maintaining accuracy
- Implemented multi-language pattern recognition (40+ patterns)
- Added smart contextual score detection with fallback methods
- Enhanced debugging tools with compact, organized information display

**July 16, 2025**: Added user authentication system with login/registration functionality for user-specific data storage.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: Streamlit web application providing an interactive user interface
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM for robust data storage
- **Business Logic**: Separate modules for scoring algorithms and database management
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts and data visualization

## Key Components

### 1. Main Application (`app.py`)
- **Purpose**: Entry point and UI controller
- **Key Features**:
  - User authentication system with login and registration
  - Multi-page navigation (Daily Tracking, Historical Analysis, Import Data, Export Data)
  - Streamlit configuration and layout management
  - Page routing and component orchestration
  - PDF data import with automatic text extraction and manual entry options
  - Screenshot import with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for multiple image processing
  - Bilingual support (English/Spanish) for both PDF and image text extraction
  - User-specific data storage and isolation

### 2. Database Manager (`database.py`)
- **Purpose**: Handles all data persistence and retrieval operations using PostgreSQL
- **Key Features**:
  - User authentication with secure password hashing
  - SQLAlchemy ORM with proper database schema definition
  - User-specific data isolation with foreign key relationships
  - Daily entry saving with date-based updates and conflict resolution
  - Data validation and consistency management
  - Supports both PHQ-9 (9 questions) and GAD-7 (7 questions) response storage
  - Multi-user support with separate data tracking per user

### 3. Scoring System (`scoring.py`)
- **Purpose**: Implements clinical scoring algorithms
- **Key Features**:
  - PHQ-9 depression scoring with 14-day rolling calculations
  - Severity level classification (Minimal, Mild, Moderate, Moderately Severe, Severe)
  - Clinical-standard scoring methodology based on symptom frequency

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in or register to access their personal data
2. **Data Input**: Users select symptoms through Streamlit interface
3. **Data Processing**: Responses are structured and validated by DatabaseManager
4. **Data Storage**: Entries are saved to PostgreSQL database with user-specific indexing
5. **Data Analysis**: Scoring algorithms calculate clinical scores from user's historical data
6. **Data Visualization**: Plotly generates interactive charts for trend analysis
7. **Data Import**: PDF files and screenshots can be processed to extract or manually enter assessment scores
8. **Data Export**: Users can export their personal data in various formats

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for the user interface
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust relational database for data persistence
- **SQLAlchemy**: Object-relational mapping (ORM) for database operations
- **Psycopg2**: PostgreSQL adapter for Python
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Plotly**: Interactive data visualization (both Express and Graph Objects)
- **PDFplumber & PyPDF2**: PDF text extraction for importing assessment data
- **Pytesseract**: OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for extracting text from images
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Image processing and manipulation for screenshot handling
- **Python Standard Library**: datetime, os, json, re for basic operations

### Data Storage
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Robust relational database with ACID compliance
- **Multi-User Architecture**: Separate user accounts with secure authentication
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL and related credentials for secure connection
- **Data Isolation**: Each user's data is completely separate and secure

## Deployment Strategy

The application is designed for simple deployment:

- **Local Development**: Direct Python/Streamlit execution
- **Cloud Deployment**: Compatible with Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or similar platforms
- **Data Persistence**: File-based storage allows for easy backup and migration
- **No External Services**: Self-contained application with minimal dependencies

### Architecture Decisions

1. **PostgreSQL Database**: Chosen for data integrity, concurrent access, and robust querying capabilities
2. **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Provides database abstraction and schema management
3. **User Authentication**: Simple but secure login system with password hashing for data privacy
4. **Streamlit Framework**: Provides rapid development of data applications with built-in widgets
5. **Modular Design**: Separate concerns for database management, scoring, and UI for maintainability
6. **Client-Side Processing**: All calculations performed locally for privacy and simplicity
7. **Rolling Score Calculation**: Uses 14-day windows to align with clinical assessment standards
8. **Multi-User Support**: Each user maintains their own separate data with complete isolation

The application prioritizes user privacy, simplicity, and clinical accuracy while maintaining a clean, extensible codebase.
